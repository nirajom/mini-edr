# 🛡️ Mini-EDR – Endpoint Detection & Response System

Mini-EDR is a **behavior-based Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR)** system built using Python.
It monitors **process activity, file system behavior, and network traffic** to detect:

- Suspicious script execution
- Ransomware-like mass file modification
- Possible C2 (Command & Control) network beaconing

The project also includes a **SOC-style web dashboard** to visualize security alerts.
